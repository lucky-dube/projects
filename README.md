#### Are you happier in town or the country

This paper is an econometrics project, written as part of the Applied Statistics and Econometrics module on the Birkbeck, University of London GDip Economics programme.

Abstract:

This project investigates the bivariate relationship between local authority mean estimates for self-reported happiness in England and Scotland and the proportion of local authority population resident in rural areas. Data are drawn from the 2011/12 Office for National Statistics headline estimates for personal wellbeing, and DEFRA and Scottish Government rural-urban population data. The results find a statistically significant association between the two variables. Analysis of subsets of data relating to England and Scotland find the association is stronger in Scotland. The project concludes by suggesting areas for further study and how they can support the development of public policy.
