#### Did the result of the EU referendum induce precautionary saving?
This is a dissertation submitted as part of an MSc in Economics.It investigates the effect of the shock to economic policy uncertainty caused by the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union on household savings decisions in the nine months after the result of the referendum was announced. The results find no evidence of precautionary saving in response to Brexit. That there was no precautionary saving response suggests that households did not believe their jobs were at risk as a result of the Brexit vote.

#### State of the Unions
This is the annex of a breifing paper published by the Adam Smith Institute. The paper provides analysis of data relating to the students' union sector and advocates constraining political activity to free up resources, which can used to increase service provision. The .pdf file is a write-up of the data analysis I carried out for the breifing paper.

#### Life expectancy and per capita GDP
This paper investigates the bivariate relationship between life expectancy and per capita GDP. Data on country level life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2017 are drawn from Gapminder.  The results find a statistically significant association between life expectancy and the logarithm of per capita GDP.

#### Dividends and earnings in the S&P 500 1871 - 2016
This paper investigates the relationship between dividends and earnings in the S\&P 500 in the 1871 to 2016 period. Data on dividends and earnings for the entire period are drawn from the US stock market dataset on Robert J. Shillerâ€™s website. The results find that dividends are significantly associated with dividends in the previous year, and earnings in the current and previous years. The results also find that the ratio of dividends to income is not constant in the long run.
