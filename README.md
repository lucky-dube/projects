#### State of the Unions
This is the annex of a breifing paper published by the Adam Smith Institute. The paper provides analysis of data relating to the students' union sector and advocates constraining political activity to free up resources, which can used to increase service provision. The .pdf file is a write-up of the data analysis I carried out for the breifing paper.

#### Are you happier in town or the country
This project investigates the bivariate relationship between local authority mean estimates for self-reported happiness in England and Scotland and the proportion of local authority population resident in rural areas. Data are drawn from the 2011/12 Office for National Statistics headline estimates for personal wellbeing, and DEFRA and Scottish Government rural-urban population data. The results find a statistically significant association between the two variables. Analysis of subsets of data relating to England and Scotland find the association is stronger in Scotland. The project concludes by suggesting areas for further study and how they can support the development of public policy.

#### Life expectancy and per capita GDP
This paper investigates the bivariate relationship between life expectancy and per capita GDP. Data on country level life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2017 are drawn from Gapminder.  The results find a statistically significant association between life expectancy and the logarithm of per capita GDP.

#### Dividends and earnings in the S&P 500 1871 - 2016
This paper investigates the relationship between dividends and earnings in the S\&P 500 in the 1871 to 2016 period. Data on dividends and earnings for the entire period are drawn from the US stock market dataset on Robert J. Shillerâ€™s website. The results find that dividends are significantly associated with dividends in the previous year, and earnings in the current and previous years. The results also find that the ratio of dividends to income is not constant in the long run.
